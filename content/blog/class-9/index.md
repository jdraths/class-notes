## Look Ahead

In the weeks ahead we are going to start building video games and other projects you all will enjoy.
Everything you've done so far in building your websites is a building block that you will use daily when building a video game.

So take today; make some edits to your website. Make it yours. And be proud of how far you've come.

## Celebrate! Here are your websites!

## Go make them yours

I put directions for how to edit your pages in [Class 6](../class-6/), but here is the edit process in summary:

    1. Go find the page / text you want to edit by searching for it
    2. Remember in codesandbox you have to toggle the edit button on the markdown pages (see step 3.0 in Class 6)
    3. Commit and push
    4. Create pull request
    5. Merge your pull request in GitHub if you want to deploy your code to production

You can follow the detailed directions in [Class 6](../class-6/).
And work together!

## Next week: Mario on replit

[Here's a sneak peek](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/build-mario-with-kaboom) of where we're going next week.

The world is at your fingertips. Let's go get it.

# Ian, Daniela, Ariana

If you also want to deploy your websites you should work together to deploy on Fleek.co. I emailed Ian the remaining directions. It's very similar to everyone else's deployments on Netlify. (Netlify started restricting our deployments last week). We can do this together next week as well.
