### Knowing how to build software is a Super Power

[7.7 Billion](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+people+in+the+world&oq=how+many+people+in+the+world&aqs=chrome..69i57.3643j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) people in the world

[73 Million](https://octoverse.github.com/#lets-look-back-at-the-code-and-communities-built-on-git-hub-this-year) developers on Github

1% - Less than 1% of the world is developers.
Just by getting this far you are already in the top 1% of the world.

### Some amazing things have been accomplished with Software

#### Software allows for instant successes

***Instagram*** - Founded in 2010, had 1 million users within 2 months, had 10 million users within 12 months & was acquired for $1 Billion within 18 months...

***Clash of Clans*** - Launched in 2012, by 2014 was making $500k per day, by 2015 was making [$1.5 Million per day](https://www.businessinsider.com/clash-of-clans-earns-15-million-a-day-as-top-grossing-app-2015-6)

***Coinbase*** - Founded in 2012. Today does $8 Billion per year in revenue

#### Software attracts some of the smartest people in the world

***Robert Refkin*** - 43 year old. African American. Founded Compass, Inc in 2012. Compass is now one of the largest Real Estate Brokers in the world & does $6 Billion in Revenue

#### Building Software teaches you persistence & problem solving

***Steve Jobs*** - an amazing role model for persistence & problem solving. [In High School Steve Jobs looked up Bill Hewlitt's home telephone number & called him to ask for parts.](https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/steve-jobs-the-childhood-of-a-great-inventor/)

#### Understanding the basics of software is worthwhile even if you don't want to BUILD software

There are other needs in the software space aside from the direct developers. We need:

***Designers*** - understand how to make software user friendly & aesthetically pleasing

***Marketers*** - people who can promote & sell products. The most amazing software in the world is USELESS if it is unknown.

***Project Managers*** - understand how to ORGANIZE a team. PMs know how to get the most out of each individual team member. The best PMs make life easier for the other team-members (developers, designers, marketing).
