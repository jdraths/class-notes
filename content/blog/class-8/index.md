## Last Week

Ok, where did we get stuck? Two places I think:

1. our `base directory`, `build command`, and `publish directory` fields in Netlify didn't seem right
2. so then our builds were failing
3. we also were blocked on creating our own subdomains & attaching those to our netlify deployment

Let's take these issues 1 by 1 today

## 1. Netlify Build Settings

Last week we got to this point:
![netlify-build-settings](./images/netlify-build-settings.png)

But our builds never succeeded.

I figured this out by going to `package.json` and checking our scripts. If I run `npm run build` I'll see a new `public` folder get created with our site content in it... this is our publish directory. It's a little confusing, but it will make more sense as we build more projects.
![build-script](./images/build-script.png)

So with that new knowledge what should our `publish directory` be in Netlify?

```sh
class-notes/public
```

- `class-notes` because that's our `base directory` (where all our project files are kept in our repo).
- `public` because that's where `npm run build` output files to

OK, putting all that together:
![final-build-settings](./images/final-build-settings.png)

## 2. rebuild your site

After saving your build settings in Netlify you need to go trigger a new build (or deploy). This is under the `Deploys` tab in the top nav of the Netlify site
![trigger-deploy](./images/trigger-deploy.png)

## 3. fix our subdomains

For this we were blocked by a Netlify setting. Since my Netlify account controlled the `altuscodes.xyz` domain then your Netlify accounts weren't allowed to add subdomains like `ian.altuscodes.xyz`. So I fixed this by relocating `altuscodes.xyz` to a Netlify competitor, Fleek. Now you should all be able to create your own subdomains.

Let's do it.

### Edit your domain settings

This is in Netlify in the `Site Overview` tab:
![navigating-domain-settings](./images/navigating-domain-settings.png)

Add domain alias:
![domain-alias](./images/domain-alias.png)
