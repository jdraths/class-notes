## What did we learn today?

1. Hacking is a lot of guess work...

    * copy & paste into sonic pi & you never know what might happen
    * we had errors without much detail... so hard to debug

2. Google is your friend

    * most of how we got around was via google
    * if you ever run into a problem... google normally has an answer

3. It's hard to communicate without written words...
    * that's why we have this site now...
